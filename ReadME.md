## Motivation
I had previously enrolled in a  [Microsoft Build: .NET Challenge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/challenges?id=150aae80-e46b-4a07-894a-5247fcdfcbad) but couldn't complete it in time. This year, one of my goals was to go through all the modules and complete that. As of today there are 33 modules inside the learning path and I plan to separate them into folders.

## Prerequisites
Access to Microsoft Learn modules.
<br />A laptop or computer with VS Code installed.
